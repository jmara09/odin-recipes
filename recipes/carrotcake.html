    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      This carrot cake recipe with a homemade cream cheese frosting is my
      favorite, and I have tried many carrot cakes! It's moist, easy to make
      with grated carrots, and so delicious!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Sugars</b>: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners'
        sugar for the frosting.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Oil</b>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without
        imparting flavor.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Eggs</b>: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake
        batter together.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Vanilla</b>: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one
        teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter
        together.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Leaveners</b>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which
        means they help the cake rise.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Cinnamon</b>: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you
        associate with carrot cake.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Salt</b>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it
        won't make the cake taste salty.
      </li>

      <li><b>Carrots</b>: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>

      <li>
        <b>Pecans</b>: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant
        crunch.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Butter</b> and <b>cream cheese</b>: Butter and cream cheese are the
        key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Make the batter</b>: Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in
        the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Bake the cake</b>: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or
        pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Frost the cake</b>: Beat the frosting ingredients together until
        smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely cooled)
        cake.
      </li>
    </ol>
