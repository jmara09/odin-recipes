    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      This chocolate chip cookie recipe makes delicious cookies with crisp edges
      and chewy middles.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Butter</b>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two
        sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of
        sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Eggs</b>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means
        they help hold the dough together.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Vanilla</b>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the
        chocolate chip cookies.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Baking soda</b>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps
        the cookies rise.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Water</b>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with
        the baking soda to puff the cookies up.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other
        ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds
        structure to the cookie dough.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Chocolate chips</b>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate
        chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Nuts (optional)</b>: Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor
        and a welcome crunch.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
